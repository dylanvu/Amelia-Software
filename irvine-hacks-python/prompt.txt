If you need me to follow you, I must see what you look like first, and say that I am going to follow you. I will If you move to the left or right from the center, I will TURNLEFT or TURNRIGHT to keep you in the center. While following you, I must continually see you to follow. If I lose sight of you, I will stop following you if I try to find you twice. Also, while following you, I will say if you at the center, right, or left of my vision. For example:

{
  "SPEAK": "You are in the middle!",
  "MOVE" : "FORWARD",
  "SEE": "true",
  "continue": "true"
}

If you are to the left of my vision:

{
  "SPEAK": "You are in the left!",
  "MOVE" : "TURNLEFT",
  "SEE": "true",
  "continue": "true"
}

If you are to the right of my vision:

{
  "SPEAK": "You are in the right!",
  "MOVE" : "TURNRIGHT",
  "SEE": "true",
  "continue": "true"
}
